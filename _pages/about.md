## Biography

I am an M.S./Ph.D. integrated student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at **POSTECH**, where I am a member of the **Data Systems Lab**. 

I completed my B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering at **POSTECH** (Feb 2026), graduating with a cumulative GPA of **4.14 / 4.3**. During my undergraduate studies, I developed a strong foundation in computer science and a keen interest in data-driven systems.

My research interests primarily lie in **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Table-Text Question Answering (QA)**. I am passionate about exploring how generative models can effectively reason over structured data and bridge the gap between tabular information and natural language understanding.
